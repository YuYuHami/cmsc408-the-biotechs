## Project description

Bioinformatics tools are essential for effectively managing and analyzing biological data, especially with massive data volumes yielded by current technological advancements such as NGS. Among the many tools that now exist, it can be challenging to find a fitting tool for your own research purposes. This project aims to create a database that would compile information about existing bioinformatics tools from many different categories (with information including their use cases, associated repositories, documentation, and official journal publications), to make it easier to filter and browse tools in search of those that would best suit your needs.

[Deliverable 8](reports/deliver-08.html) details the planned design for the database.

[Delieverable 12](reports/deliver-12.html) details the final implementation of the database as a web application.

The web application itself can be launched via Docker by running the following command in the project root, and then visiting ```localhost``` in your browser:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
